<h2>Copyright</h2>
The contents of this Organization are in the Public Domain. Anyone may download and modify any content in any way. I put this first because I want others to feel free to use the information and images. However, if you have any class, you won't use them to train AI ðŸ™ƒ.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this Organization is to be a base of permanent image links for citations in later projects, including an Aeon Timeline of the Royal Navy in World War II, and in-depth studies of individual convoys in the same conflict.
It is not meant to look pretty or like a finished project. These are some of the raw materials from which this author is starting.

<h2>Sources and How to Use/Read</h2>
The repositories beginning with "ADM" come from the <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/4697018?limit=100&q=admiralty%20war%20diaries&sort=title%3Aasc">US National Archives Website</a>. The syntax is thus:

ADM-year-month-[to-year-month]-NAID.

On the US National Archives website, NAID is found on the item card, as marked below:

<h2>Other Resources</h2>

I have plans to upload the full pdfs to my website, <a href="https://navalhistorianatlarge.org">Hamatiti's Ever-Larger Doodles</a>, but this may not happen soon, as I am still pushing repos to this Organization.
